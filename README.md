End-to-End Multilingual Pipeline: Successfully integrates three distinct AI components—ASR (simulated), LLM, and TTS—into a seamless, conversational flow.

Local Language Focus (Telugu): Directly addresses the assignment constraint by utilizing Telugu (te-IN) for the entire application, showcasing robust localization capabilities outside of English or Hindi.

Real-Time Voice Output: Features advanced Text-to-Speech (TTS) generation to convert the LLM's Telugu response into playable audio in real-time, fulfilling the interactive requirement.

Technical Compatibility: Implemented as a single, portable Python file using the Streamlit framework, allowing for easy execution and demonstration on any local machine or immediate deployment to cloud services like Streamlit Community Cloud.

Robust Architecture: The pipeline is built upon dedicated Gemini APIs, ensuring high-quality, high-speed performance for both LLM processing and audio synthesis.
